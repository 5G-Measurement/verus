{"name":"VERUS","tagline":"An adaptive congestion control protocol that is custom designed for cellular networks","body":"Verus, an end-to-end congestion control protocol that uses delay measurements to react quickly to the capacity changes in cellular networks without explicitly attempting to predict the cellular channel dynamics. The key idea of Verus is to continuously learn a delay profile that captures the relationship between end-to-end packet delay and outstanding window size over short epochs and uses this relationship to increment or decrement the window size based on the observed short-term packet delay variations. While the delay-based control is primarily for congestion avoidance, Verus uses standard TCP features including multiplicative decrease upon packet loss and slow start.\r\n\r\n### Paper\r\n[Adaptive Congestion Control for Unpredictable Cellular Networks](http://cs.nyu.edu/~jchen/publications/sigcomm15-zaki.pdf)\r\n\r\nYasir Zaki1, Thomas Poetsch2, Jay Chen1, Lakshminarayanan Subramanian3, Carmelita Goerg2  \r\n1New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE  \r\n2University of Bremen, Germany  \r\n3NYU and CTED, USA\r\n\r\nTo appear in ACM SIGCOMM 2015  \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
